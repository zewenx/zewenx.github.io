# This is the brief guite for the interview.
## The first part is just collecting some materials that related to 2022 plan of Telstrraa.
### Radically simplify our product offerings, eliminate customer pain points and create all digital experiences
- for simplify the customer product offerings, Telstra has applied [these actions](https://www.telstra.com.au/aboutus/media/media-releases/Telstra-sets-new-strategy-to-improve-customer-experience-simplify-structure-and-cut-costs). Apart from that, you can see more about [how to simplify customer services](https://www.digitalistmag.com/customer-experience/2017/08/25/5-ways-simplify-customer-service-keep-consumers-happy-05297656)
- Pain points
  - Waster time
  - Spend lots of money but received bad service
  - didnt get help in time when necessary

- Customer experience (Based on the experience we had at 4:30pm, 7/4/19)
  - No staff come to us after we look around for a while(8mins)
  - Some staff are chatting with each other but pay no attension to customers
  - No mobile models are shown when there are at least 30 mins to close
  - Every time we have to ask for how the models looks like, then staffs will show it (waste time)
  - some Models are out of power.
  -  Since the price of telstra is higher than other mobile network provider, there is no evidence to prove that the network of telstra is faster. (The staff said it is because of the large coverage and faster speed), No straitforward presentation on the store prove that coverage is larger
-  [tansforming customer experience](https://exchange.telstra.com.au/transforming-the-customer-experience/) is something how they improve custromer experience with new technology. And also, Telstra released a [whitebook](https://www.telstra.com.au/content/dam/tcom/business-enterprise/campaigns/pdf/contact-centre-whitepaper.pdf) to explain their customer strategy. On the other hand, [this arlticle](https://www.telstra.com.au/content/dam/tcom/business-enterprise/network-services/pdf/business-network-better-service-customers-employees.pdf) mentions that the relationship between customer service and network (5G and more).
